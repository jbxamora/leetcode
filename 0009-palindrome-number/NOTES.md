The solution uses a Python class, Solution, which has a single method called `isPalindrome.`
The input to the method is an integer `x`.
If the number is `negative`, we know it can't be a palindrome, so we return `False`.
Next, we convert the number to a string using the `str` function.
We then use string slicing to reverse the string and compare it to the original string. If they are `equal`, then the number is a palindrome, so we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.
This solution is highly optimized for `time`, since it only converts the input number to a string once, and then performs a single string comparison. The string comparison is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string, but in practice, the length of the string is limited by the number of digits in the input integer, which is typically small.
