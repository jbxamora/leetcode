Problem statement: Given an integer array deck where deck[i] represents the number written on the ith card, the task is to partition the cards into one or more groups such that:

Each group has exactly x cards where x > 1.
All the cards in one group have the same integer written on them.
The function should return True if such partition is possible, or False otherwise.

One approach to solve this problem is to calculate the frequencies of each integer in the deck array using a dictionary. Then, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the frequencies. If the GCD is greater than 1, then it means we can partition the deck into groups of size GCD, where each group has the same integer written on all the cards. Otherwise, it is not possible to partition the deck.

The steps to get the solution of this problem are as follows:

Define a function hasGroupsSizeX(deck) that takes an integer array deck as input.

Create a dictionary freq to count the frequency of each integer in the deck array.

Find the GCD of all the values in the freq dictionary using the reduce() function and the gcd() function.

Return True if the GCD is greater than 1, and False otherwise.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n), where n is the size of the deck. The space complexity is O(n) to store the dictionary of frequencies.

Appendix:

The collections.Counter() function can also be used to count the frequency of each integer in the deck array. This function returns a dictionary that maps each element in the input list to its frequency.

The math.gcd() function can be used instead of defining a separate gcd() function. This function calculates the GCD of two or more integers.

The reduce() function is part of the functools module, which needs to be imported to use this function. Alternatively, a loop can be used to calculate the GCD of all the values in the freq dictionary.

The while b: a, b = b, a % b line in the gcd() function is the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers. This algorithm involves iteratively dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD of the two numbers.
