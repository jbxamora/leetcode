â€‹Define a function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. In the provided solution, this function is defined as `gcd(a`,` b)`.

Count the frequency of each integer in the deck array using collections.Counter(deck).values(). This creates a list of frequencies of each unique integer in the deck.

Find the GCD of all the frequencies in the list using the `reduce()` function and the `gcd()` function. If the GCD is greater than 1, then it means we can partition the deck into groups of size GCD, where each group has the same integer written on all the cards. Otherwise, it is not possible to partition the deck.

Return `True` if the GCD is greater than 1, and `False` otherwise.

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n log n)`, where n is the size of the deck. The space complexity is O(n) to store the list of frequencies.

Here are some additional notes based on the provided solution:

The `reduce()` function applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence, from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value. In the provided solution, reduce(gcd, count) applies the `gcd()` function to all the elements of the count list in a cumulative way until a single value is obtained, which is the GCD of all the elements.

The `collections.Counter()` function creates a dictionary that maps each element in the input list to its frequency. The values() method returns a list of all the values in the dictionary, which correspond to the frequencies of each unique element in the input list.

The while `b: a, b = b, a % b` line in the `gcd()` function is a shorthand way of writing a while loop that continues until b is equal to `0`. In each iteration of the loop, a is assigned to b, and b is assigned to the remainder of a divided by b. This way, the GCD of the two numbers is calculated.
