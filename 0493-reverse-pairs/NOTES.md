BBST-based Solution
​
## Step-by-step explanation of the solution
​
1. **Problem analysis:**
The problem asks us to find the number of important reverse pairs in the given array, which means we need to count the pairs (i, j) where i < j and nums[i] > 2 * nums[j]. This suggests that we need to compare elements in the array, but comparing each element with every other element would result in a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not efficient for large arrays.
​
2. **Balanced Binary Search Trees (BBST):**
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BBST) data structure, such as an AVL tree or a Red-Black tree, which maintains a sorted order of the elements and supports insertion, deletion, and search operations with a time complexity of O(log n).
​
3. **Using a BBST to count reverse pairs:**
We iterate through the input array and maintain a sorted list (or BBST) of the elements we've seen so far. For each element, we count the number of elements in the sorted list that are less than or equal to twice the current element (i.e., 2 * nums[j] <= nums[i]). This is done using the `bisect_right()` function, which has a time complexity of O(log n). Then, we add the current element to the sorted list (BBST), which also has a time complexity of O(log n).
​
4. **Time complexity:**
The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n) because the most expensive operations, `bisect_right()` and `add()`, both have a time complexity of O(log n). This is an efficient solution compared to a naive comparison-based approach with a time complexity of O(n^2).
​
5. **Space complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) because we need to store the elements in the sorted list (BBST).
​
In summary, the solution uses a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BBST)-based approach to efficiently count the important reverse pairs in the array with a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(n). This is more efficient than a naive comparison-based solution with a time complexity of O(n^2) and is an alternative to the Merge Sort-based solution.
