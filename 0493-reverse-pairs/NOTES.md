Merge Sort Based Solution
​
## Step-by-step explanation of the solution
​
1. **Problem analysis:**
The problem asks us to find the number of important reverse pairs in the given array, which means we need to count the pairs (i, j) where i < j and nums[i] > 2 * nums[j]. This suggests that we need to compare elements in the array, but comparing each element with every other element would result in a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not efficient for large arrays.
​
2. **Merge Sort:**
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the Merge Sort algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively splits the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together. The key insight is that when we merge the sorted halves, we can also count the important reverse pairs.
​
3. **Counting reverse pairs during the merge:**
When we merge two sorted halves of the array, we can count the important reverse pairs as follows:
- Initialize two pointers, i and j, to the start of the first and second halves, respectively.
- For each element nums[i] in the first half, we can count the number of elements nums[j] in the second half such that nums[i] > 2 * nums[j]. Since the second half is sorted, we can do this using a single pass with pointer j.
- We increment the count by the number of important reverse pairs found for each element nums[i] in the first half.
​
4. **Merging sorted halves:**
After counting the important reverse pairs, we need to merge the sorted halves back together to maintain the sorted order for the next level of recursion. This step has a time complexity of O(n) in each recursive call.
​
5. **Time complexity:**
The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n) because Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), and counting the important reverse pairs during the merge step adds an additional O(n) time complexity per recursive call, which doesn't change the overall time complexity.
​
6. **Space complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), as we need to allocate additional space for the merged array during the merge step. This space is proportional to the length of the input array.
​
In summary, the solution uses a Merge Sort-based approach to efficiently count the important reverse pairs in the array with a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(n). This is more efficient than a naive comparison-based solution with a time complexity of O(n^2).
