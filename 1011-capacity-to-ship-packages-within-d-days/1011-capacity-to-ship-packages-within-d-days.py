# Here's how the solution works:

# The shipWithinDays function takes in a list of integers weights and an integer D as input, and returns the minimum weight capacity of a ship that can ship all the packages within D days.
# The function uses binary search to find the minimum weight capacity in O(log n) time complexity.
# The search range is initialized to be between the maximum weight in weights and the sum of all the weights.
# In each iteration of the loop, the mid point is set to the middle of the search range.
# We then check if the current weight capacity is feasible by simulating the shipping process for D days. We use two variables days and total to keep track of the current day and the current weight total, respectively. We iterate over weights and add each weight to total. If total exceeds the current weight capacity mid, we increment days and reset total to the current weight. At the end of the iteration, we check if the number of days days is greater than D. If it is, then the current capacity is not feasible and we update the search range to the right of mid. Otherwise, the current capacity is feasible and we update the search range to the left of mid.
# We continue this process until the search range has converged to a single weight capacity, at which point we return the minimum weight capacity.
