This solution uses two nested loops to check all possible substrings of `s`. For each substring, it creates a set `ss` of the characters in the substring. It then checks if all the lower and upper case versions of each character in the set `ss` are present in `ss` using `all(c.lower() in ss and c.upper() in ss for c in ss)`. If this condition is met and the length of the current substring is greater than the length of the current `ans`, it updates `ans` to the current substring.
​
Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`, which is the longest "nice" substring.
