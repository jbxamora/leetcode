I use a dictionary `last_seen` to store the last seen index of each character because it allows me to quickly check whether a character is already in the current substring and find its last seen index.
I initialize the starting index of the current substring `(start)` to `0` and the maximum length of the substring `(max_len)` to `0` because the longest substring without repeating characters must start from some index and cannot be negative.
I use a for loop with enumerate to loop through each character in the string and its index, because I need to keep track of both the characters and their positions.
I check whether a character is already in the current substring and find its last seen index using if char in last_seen and `last_seen[char] >= start`, because if the character is not in the current substring, I don't need to update the starting index.
I update the last seen index of each character using `last_seen[char] = i`, so that I can find the last seen index of each character in the future.
I update the maximum length of the substring using `max_len = max(max_len, i - start + 1)`, because the length of the current substring is `i - start + 1`.
I return the maximum length of the substring at the end, because that is the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
